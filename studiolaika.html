      <h1>Claymation and Stop-Motion: The Animation Techniques that made Laika Studio</h1>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><em>Laika</em> is an American animation studio that was founded in 2005 by Phil Knight, the current president/CEO is Travis Knight. This studio is best know for their five films, <em> Coraline, ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls, Kubo and the Two Strings,</em> and <em>Missing Link</em>. Their latest film, <em>Missing Link</em>, just received a Golden Globe for best animated feature and is currently nominated for an Oscar in the same category. I’ve been a fan of this studio since I was a little kid. I loved the movie, <em>Coraline</em>, as a kid (even though it gave me so many nightmares). I was fascinated on how they were able to make these simple figures move like real people. I had no idea that their movies were created with a specific animation technique until I was older. I just knew I liked how everything looked and wanted to see more by them. I eventually learned that the techniques that their studio focused on was stop-motion animation and claymation. For this article, I’m going to be focusing on these techniques, try to give some history on them, and show how <em>Laika</em> does it all.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">To start off, I’m going talk about what stop-motion is. Stop-motion (also known as stop frame animation) is a type of animation that is captured one frame at a time. In between each frames, the objects are moved in whatever way the animator wants. When the sequence is played back, it creates an illusion of movement. This technique goes back as far as the 1898, maybe even further. The first documented film, <em>The Humpty Dumpty Circus</em>, is credited to J. Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith. It’s a long, tedious technique that needs to be done just right in order to keep a constant flow. It is one of the reasons why it takes 3-5 years for <em>Laika</em> to make a movie.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">However, even though the process is long, it gives the movie a unique form of storytelling. The studio even post time lapses of making their figures moves. The video that I linked showed some of their characters making fun of the animators who work on things like stop-motion. It’s a fun way to make fun of themselves while doing something they love. Since this process is rather long and tedious, the audience can tell that the movies are definitely made with love. If the animators did not love what they did, they would have given up on the stop-motion right away. Especially when claymation is also added to this technique.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">What exactly is claymation though? In the <em>Collins’ Dictionary</em>, claymation is defined as “a process of photographing a kind of animated cartoon using three-dimensional clay puppet figures.” This form of animation was invented a little bit after Plasticine was invented in 1897. The first film to ever feature this animation was created back in 1908. The film was called <em>The Sculptor’s Nightmare</em> and it combined claymation with live action footage for the first time ever. Claymation has been used since then, but had not become a big thing until around the 1980’s. However, this form of animation is still rarely used now of days because how long and tedious it is (which means stop-motion and claymation are perfect for each other). This technique probably would be rarely seen in today’s media, if it wasn’t for <em>Laika</em>.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">In everyone of <em>Laika</em>’s films, they create several figures for every characters. These characters’ are also very unique, everyone looks very different from the other. So, they have to replicate the characters’ uniqueness for each figure. That also means the same thing for the several extra faces they make for each characters. This way the animators don’t have to constantly change the figures even more so. They also have to be extremely careful when changing these figures and their motions. If they slip up at all, they will have to start over from the very beginning of the scene. Yet, knowing this, the studio still continues to make these films with these techniques.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">In my personal opinion, <em>Laika</em> is an extremely underappreciated studio. Their movies are beyond unique, from the plot to the character design. Everyone behind these films only put love and compassion into all of them. If the animators did not love what they were doing, the audience would clearly be able to see, unlike other animated films. These films are works of art, yet a good portion of people do not seem to care for them. People find the style odd looking, a good portion of kids are scared of these movies, and some just ignore them since they are “kid movies.”This studio deserves more praise for working with techniques that some animators would not even dare touch. Especially when now of days, a majority of animated films are created by one company (looking at you, <em>Disney</em>). <em>Laika</em> is a small company that deserves more love and recognition for its original work. I can only hope that with this years award season, <em>Laika</em> will get more love for their film, <em>Missing Link</em>.</p>
