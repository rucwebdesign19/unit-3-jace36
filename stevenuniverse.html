      <h1>"We Deserve to Shine:" Lessons in Self-Love and LGBTQ Representation Shown in <em>Steven Universe</em></h1>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><em>Steven Universe</em>, created by Rebecca Sugar, is an animated American series that first premiered on November 4, 2013. The show is currently on it final season, and believed to be finished in 2020. The show follows Steven Universe, a hybrid son of a human man, Greg Universe, and an alien gem warrior, Rose Quartz (Steven inherited Rose’s gem). The audience watches Steven as he attempts to grow up like a regular human boy and adapt to his growing gem powers. Steven lives with the Crystal Gems, Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl. They raises him in honor of their former leader, Rose, who gave up her life so Steven could be born. Since the show has been going on for so long and has a lot of story arcs, there is plenty to talk about. However, I am going to attempt to narrow it down as much as I can without giving too much of the show away (there will be spoilers though). I mainly want to focus on how this show is an extremely LGBTQ friendly show (especially for a children’s show), how it tries to teach self-love and respect for yourself and those around you.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">The first season of the show is not very plot heavy (mostly because they didn’t know if they would get a second season), it’s focuses mostly on Steven and his development. It didn’t start to get plot heavy until closer to the end of the first season. Even without a heavy plot, the audience does learn a little more about the gems themselves. The audience learned towards the end of the first season that the Crystal Gems came from an alien empire. This empire is rule by the diamonds (White, Yellow, Blue, and Pink Diamonds) and they expand their empire by destroying other planets. They tried to destroy Earth and all the life on it, in order to create more Gems. However, the Crystal Gems were a rebellion that fought against the empire to protect all the life on Earth. Earth was a place where gems were allowed to be themselves, without the fear of being “shattered” (aka killed). Back on their Homeworld, gems had to be perfect. If a gem was flawed in anyway, then they would be killed. This is one of the reasons why the show it is so big on things like self-love/acceptance. Especially since the Crystal Gems have been fighting to protect the right for Gems to be themselves and to not live in fear. It’s such big theme of the show, that Dove asked to do a partnership with the show to create a line of commercials that celebrated body positivity and self esteem. So, I’m going to focus on Steven Universe, point out times he is full of self love and times when he needs to be reminded how to love himself.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">So to begin, I’ll start by explaining how Steven feels about himself. Steven is a character that shows self-love, while also struggling to fully love himself through out the series. He’s basically a contradiction, but he’s also a growing boy. It’s normal for kids to contradict themselves when they’re growing up. At times, Steven is a young boy, who isn’t afraid to wear a dress and sing on a stage in front of his whole town. Those are the times when Steven loves who he is and doesn’t care what others think. Yet, Steven still struggles with fully loving himself because of his mother, Rose Quartz. After learning about the Gem Wars and more about his mother, Steven becomes unsure in himself and wonders if he actually is himself or just his mom. Since Steven has Rose’s gem, he is never fully sure if he actually is just Steven or if he has been his mother all along (I know, very confusing for people who don’t actually watch the show, but just go with it). Especially since new gems, including the Diamonds, come to Earth and believe that Steven is actually Rose Quartz (who later turns out to be Pink Diamond. Sorry for the spoiler, but it’s kinda necessary). All of this causes Steven to doubt himself and who he is. However, during the fifth season of the show, White Diamond is able to separate Steven from his gem. Steven, who has never been separated from his gem, is split into his weaken human form and his gem form. White Diamond split Steven from his gem, hoping to reveal the gems true form (Pink Diamond), but the gem form turn into a pink Steven. When White asks where the original form of the gem is, gem Steven screams “She’s gone!” before walking over to where human Steven is (Sugar). When human Steven is reunited with his gem self, he is overcome with emotions. He is happy to have a confirmation that he has always been Steven, which leads to both of the Steven’s crying and laughing with each other.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">The Stevens’ become one again and cry tears of joy over his revelation about being himself all along, is a really beautiful scene. At this moment, Steven knows that he can fully love himself because he has always been who he thought he was. It’s a beautiful moment in the show that connects with a lot of people. It shows the pure joy of finally accepting who you really are. This scene can be applied to people who are questioning their sexuality, their gender, or who they are as a person in general. It’s another reason why a lot of LGBTQ people of all ages love this show. The show helps young LGBTQ people come to term with what they’re going through; while also giving the older ones a reminder of who they are and that they should continue to love themselves.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">I could go on about all the moments of self-love that is shown throughout the show, but now I want to focus on LGBTQ representation that is shown throughout the show. One big thing that is not explicitly stated in the show but is confirmed by the creator, is the gems’ “sex.” Rebecca Sugar, the creator, confirms that all the gems are non-binary women. Sugar, being a nonbinary women, themselves, wanted to use the gems to give others the representation that Sugar has never seen before. Since they are alien gem warriors, Sugar felt it was easy to make them represent nonbinary women, which she confirms in the quote below:</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="12">One of the things that’s really important to me about the show is that the Gems are all non-binary women. They’re very specific and they’re coming from a world where they don’t really have the frame of reference. They’re coded female which is very important. I was really excited because I felt like I had not seen this. To make a show about a young boy who was looking up to these female-coded characters—they appear to be female, but they’re a little more representative of nonbinary women.<br>
      – REBECCA SUGAR (PULLIAM-MOORE)</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Just like Sugar said, there is basically no form of representation for nonbinary women in media, so Sugar decided to create it themselves. This gives a chance for younger nonbinary girls to discover who they are, earlier on in their life. The show also provides “trans representation in media by being willing to give voice to less often represented gender identities. It provides us with a framework with which to investigate how agender and genderqueer identities and experiences can not only function but thrive within the genre boundaries of the fantasy cartoon” (Dunn 47). Sugar is also able to show this through this process that the gems are able to do called fusion. Fusion is the ability to become a completely different being of one mind, with two or more gems. Fusions are seen as completely different personalities and people in general. Which has the power to give more representation for other kinds of genders. However, the participants of the fusions have to be in the same emotional state in order for the fusion to <a href="http://work.In">work.In</a> the show, fusion is often used to show relationships between a group of people.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">For example, Steven and his best friend, Connie, accidentally fuses with each other and create Stevonnie. Stevonnie is a completely different person from Steven and Connie, but they were formed from the love and friendship that Steven and Connie feel for each other. Stevonnie can be seen as a person of no gender or transgender, that is made of the love that Steven and Connie share. However, not all fusions are made of love like Stevonnie, some are shown to be abusive. Two gems, Lapis and Jasper, fused together to become Malachite. Jasper only wanted to fuse to get stronger, while Lapis only fused to keep Jasper away from Steven and his friends. They fused for the wrong reasons and when they unfused from each other, Lapis goes on about how much she hated it and how they were bad for each other. Yet, Jasper loved being fused with Lapis, because it made Jasper stronger and tries to manipulate Lapis into fusing with her again. Jasper went on to say how she has changed and that they will do better this time. This is an example of something that an abusive ex would say to try and get back together with their ex. Fusion is a way to show the younger audience how relationships are supposed to be like and what they shouldn’t be, but still keeps a magical, fun element to it.</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">I’m going to wrap this article up by highlighting one of the best things to come out of <em>Steven Universe</em>. The featured one the first ever queer wedding on a children’s TV show. The wedding was between two gems, Ruby and Sapphire, who when fused together, become Garnet. Garnet is revealed to be a fusion very early on in the series, which is one of the reasons why she joined up with the Crystal Gems. If Garnet had stayed on Homeworld, Ruby and Sapphire would have been forced to separate and then be shattered. So, they joined the Crystal Gems to fight for the freedom to exist as themselves. Although the two gems were basically already married, they felt the need to make their love official in Earth terms, since Earth was their new home. Although this show has a lot of LGBTQ rep, it has never been allowed to explicitly say that it was LGBTQ rep in the show. Sugar was only allowed to talk about it in interviews and not bring it up in the actual show, until they wrote the wedding episode for Ruby and Sapphire. At first, Cartoon Network was not going to allow this episode to air, but Sugar threatened to quit the show if they did not air this episode. Sugar fought to show Ruby and Sapphire’s love which is summed up perfectly in the quote below:</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="21">The show’s queer sensibilities extend far beyond its willingness to build an episode around a queer wedding, or to let women wear tuxedos while men don makeup and dresses. <em>Steven Universe</em>’s queerness isn’t just about the show’s superficial trappings, it’s baked into a core message: fight for love against all odds.<br>
      – Lux Alptraum</p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">Rebecca Sugar has said that they wanted “to make cartoons that are meant to be over analyzed and taken personally because they really are meaningful, ” which is something they did with Steven Universe (Mihailova 1015). She created a show full of hope, that shows what one person can achieve with love, whether it be for themselves or for others. It shows that love comes in all kinds of forms and that a person is perfect when they are allowed to be themselves. It also has amazing music that is fun, heartfelt, and emotional all in one. People of all ages can learn from Steven Universe on how to love oneself, to love and help others, and to accept people for who they are. I don’t know if Rebecca Sugar knows this, but her little show has opened up the doors for all kinds of LGBTQ children shows.</p>
